ðŸ†• Release $version is out! We updated our Apollo Federation integration to
support 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3! The main two new features are support for
`@composeDirective` and `@interfaceObject`. As usual we do have shortcuts to
make them easy to use. Read the docs for more information: https://strawberry.rocks/docs/guides/federation

Thanks @patrick91 for the PR! @apollographql
